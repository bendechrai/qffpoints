      <p>
        Hi! My name is Ben, and I like to travel. I do a fair amount for work
        and personally, and I love to maximise my status earn for as few dollars
        as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means I'm usually on the lookout for interesting routes, and tools
        like Qantas's booking system, Expert Flyer, and even Google Flights help
        out. (Google Flights is actually a great way to find cheap multi-stop
        trips.)
